The short answer is&hellip;the wonder of signal processing. Speech is simply a series of sound waves created by our vocal chords when they cause air to vibrate around them. These soundwaves are recorded by a microphone, and then converted into an electrical signal. The signal is then processed using advanced signal processing technologies, isolating syllables and words. Over time, the computer can learn to understand speech from experience, thanks to incredible recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But signal processing is what makes it all possible."
